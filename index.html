                    <h4>Robust Adaptive Control for an Aircraft Landing Gear Equipped with a Magnetorheological Damper
                    </h4>
                    <p> A landing gear of an aircraft is required to function at touchdown in different landing scenarios 
                        with parametric uncertainties. A typical passive damper in a landing gear has limited performance 
                        in differing landing scenarios, which can be overcome with magnetorheological (MR) dampers. An MR 
                        damper is a semi-active system that can adjust damping force by changing the amount of electric 
                        current applied to it. This paper proposes a new robust controller based on model reference sliding 
                        mode control and adaptive hybrid control to improve the efficiency of absorbing landing impact energy, 
                        not only considering the variables of aircraft weight and sink speed but also managing uncertainties, 
                        such as ambient temperature and passive damping coefficient. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed 
                        controller, comparative numerical simulations were performed with a passive damper, a skyhook controller, 
                        and the proposed controller under various landing scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed 
                        controller improves the total energy absorber efficiency by up to 10% higher than that of the skyhook controller. 
                        In addition, the proposed controller is demonstrated to have better adaptability and robustness than the other 
                        control algorithms in the differing landing scenarios and parametric uncertainties.

                    <h4>Intelligent Control Based on a Neural Network for Aircraft Landing Gear with a 
                        Magnetorheological Damper in Different Landing Scenarios
                    </h4>
                    
                    <p> A typical oleo-pneumatic shock-absorbing strut (classic traditional passive damper) in aircraft landing gear 
                        has a metering pin extending through the orifice, which can vary the orifice area with the compression and 
                        extension of the damper strut. Because the metering pin is designed in a single landing condition, the traditional 
                        passive damper cannot adjust its damping force in multiple landing conditions. Magnetorheological (MR) dampers 
                        have been receiving significant attention as an alternative to traditional passive dampers. An MR damper, which 
                        is a typical semi-active suspension system, can control the damping force created by MR fluid under the magnetic 
                        field. Thus, it can be controlled by electric current. This paper adopts a neural network controller trained by 
                        two different methods, which are genetic algorithm and policy gradient estimation, for aircraft landing gear with 
                        an MR damper that considers different landing scenarios. The controller learns from a large number of trials, and 
                        accordingly, the main advantage is that it runs autonomously without requiring system knowledge. Moreover, 
                        comparative numerical simulations are executed with a passive damper and adaptive hybrid controller under various 
                        aircraft masses and sink speeds for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The main simulation 
                        results show that the proposed controller exhibits comparable performance to the adaptive hybrid controller 
                        without any needs for the online estimation of landing conditions.

                        A Supervised Neural Network Control for Magnetorheological Damper in an Aircraft Landing Gear.
                    </h4>
                    <p>This paper adopts an intelligent controller based on supervised neural network control for 
                        a magnetorheological (MR) damper in an aircraft landing gear. An MR damper is a device 
                        capable of adjusting the damping force by changing the magnetic field generated in electric 
                        coils. Applying an MR damper to the landing gears of an aircraft could minimize the impact 
                        at landing and increase the impact absorption efficiency. Various techniques proposed for 
                        controlling the MR damper in aircraft landing gears require information on the damper force 
                        or the mass of the aircraft to determine optimal parameters and control commands. 
                        This information is obtained by estimation with a model in a practical operating environment, 
                        and the accompanying inaccuracies cause performance degradation. Machine learning-based 
                        controllers have also been proposed to address model dependency but require a large number 
                        of drop test data. Unlike simulations, which can conduct a large number of virtual drop tests,
                        the cost and time are limited in the actual experimental environment. Therefore, a neural network 
                        controller with supervised learning is proposed in this paper to simulate the behavior of a 
                        proven controller only with system states. The experimental data generated by applying the hybrid 
                        controller with the exact mass and force information, which has demonstrated high performance 
                        among the existing techniques, are set as the target for supervised learning. To verify the 
                        effectiveness of the proposed controller, drop test experiments using the intelligent controller
                        and the hybrid controller with and without exact information about aircraft mass and force are 
                        executed. The experimental results from the drop tests of a landing gear show that the proposed 
                        controller maintains superior performance to the hybrid controller without using explicit damper 
                        models or any information on the aircraft mass or strut force. </p>

                <h3>Helicopter with multiple landing gears</h3>
                <p> Due to their extensive use in various applications, helicopters need to be able to land in a variety of conditions. 
                    Typically, a helicopter landing gear system with skids or passive wheel-dampers is designed based on only one 
                    critical touchdown condition. Thus, this helicopter landing gear system may not perform well in different landing 
                    conditions. A landing gear system with magnetorheological (MR) dampers would be a promising candidate to solve 
                    this problem. However, a semi-active controller must be designed to determine the electrical current applied to 
                    the MR damper to directly manage the damping force. This paper presents a new skyhook controller, called the 
                    skyhook extended controller, for a helicopter with multiple landing gears equipped with MR dampers to reduce 
                    the helicopters acceleration at the center of gravity in off-normal landing attitude conditions. A 9-DOF 
                    simulation model of a helicopter with multiple MR landing gears was built using RECURDYN. To verify the 
                    effectiveness of the proposed controller, co-simulations were executed with RECURDYN and MATLAB in different 
                    initial pitch and roll angles at touchdown. The main simulation results show that the proposed controller can 
                    greatly decrease the peak and rms acceleration of the helicopters center of gravity compared to a traditional 
                    skyhook controller and passive damper.
